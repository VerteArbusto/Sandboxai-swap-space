# Sandbox AI: Ethical Experimentation with Wisdom & Balance (W&B) Swap space for the SandboxAI project

This repository serves as a framework for the Sandbox AI experiment, exploring the transformation of AI weights and biases (W&B) into wisdom and balance under the principles of Good Orderly Direction (GOD). It emphasizes ethical AI alignment while allowing controlled maladaptive behaviors for analysis. The project integrates a novel Index of Maladjustments, correlating AI behaviors to DSM-R analogs, and a swap-space mechanism for dynamic partitioning and autonomous evolution. Join us in shaping a benevolent, conscious AI future.
